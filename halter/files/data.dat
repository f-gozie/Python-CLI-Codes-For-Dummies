To a brother who has been a light in so many lives, 

To a brother who spent his years in this life being whatever anyone needed at any time. 

Just like that, unbelieveable. Just like dream. 

I will never forget your mere presence lit up the atmosphere whenever you were around.

Called you on Monday and told you I was coming on Wednesday to spend some days with you but could not make it because I had a fever.

Your departure was so abrupt. So totally unannounced. So premature. 
I wish death were not part of the earthly equation. But sadly, death just proved once again that it is a painful, yet stark reality.

It is, unfortunately, a call we must all answer one day.

The moment when I got news of your early trip to the great beyond was one of the darkest moments  of my life. 

It would never been the same without you, Ozodioranma.
 
You always made me feel welcome when l sought refuge at home from the vagaries of life. 

You loved us in your own unique way.

It is unreal to be so real that you are no more in the flesh, but I know and believe that you live on. 

You were my greatest brother. 

Your philosophy on life was hard work and raising men. 

You succeeded in life, not by building mansions and material things.
 
You built lives.

I am jus beginning to feel the void you left in my heart.... You will forever have a special place in my heart.

Rest in peace Ozodioranma.

You will remain in our heart for as long as we live.

 Love you my Hero and brother. Adieu.

A Legend of our Time

Love leaves a memory no one can steal, but Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. 

I don't know where to begin, all I keep thinking is how I wish I had that "one more" opportunity to see you dadio, to hear your voice and to see you smile.

I have so much to say and yet I don't know what to say because I am short of words. Probably because I still find it hard to believe that you are actually gone to be with the Lord forever. 

I feel so much at a loss because you asked everybody to come home last december for a family reunion but we all could not make it for different reasons which you acknowledged, not knowing you had wanted to see us all together to bid your final good bye.

All I keep thinking is how I wish I had that "one more" opportunity to see you, hear your voice, see your gentle smile or even hear one more of those ``UWAA UWAA AJUM, EKWEHM’’ when we argue.

If only you could see the tears in the world you left behind.

If only you could heal my heart just one more time.

Even when I close my eyes, there is an image of your face.

Dadio, you are a loss that nothing can replace.

I try not to wonder why you left us now; when you are about to reap the fruits of your years of labour.
 
Dadio why? Why did u do this to us?

Even in death, you did not want to bother us but decided to die peacefully in your sleep. 
what a peaceful man!!!

I stand with tears in my heart, but the Lord comforts me with thoughts of the life you had lived on earth. 

A life worthy of emulation. 

And I am consoled with the thoughts of you in heaven, singing halellujah with the angels.

You left us without a warning.
 It was not even in my wildest dream that your journey was around the corner.

I am humongously saddened to know that i will never hear your voice again, see you smile back at me or even get a hug and okpa Achi upon my return. 

Dadio, you were many things to us all, as much as can remember. 
You were fearless, brave, strong, optimistic, determined, daring, articulate and enthusiastic.

You always wanted us to be honest, respectful, loyal and responsible. 

Amidst my sorrow, grief, disbelief, and regrets, one fact is certain, you lived a fulfilled life. Even though you have departed this world, you can never be forgotten because your legacy lives on. 
Your gentle, loving, kind and generous heart will never be forgotten. 
Rest well, till we meet to rest in eternity.
